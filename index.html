            <script src='main.js'></script>
            <p>This D3 bubble chart vividly displays the distribution of goals across
                different match phases in the Qatar 2022 World Cup, categorized by continent. Each bubble represents a team, 
                with its size proportional to the number of goals scored during a specific phase of the gameâ€”Early Game, 
                Mid-Game First Half, Mid-Game Second Half, and Late Game. The colors of the bubbles are strategically used 
                to indicate the continent to which each team belongs, enhancing the visual differentiation and making it easy 
                to identify geographical patterns in playing styles or strategies. This visualization not only serves as a 
                tool for exploring how different teams perform throughout various stages of a match but also highlights
                the influence of continental football cultures on team performance. </p>

            <h3>Distribution of Non-Penalty Goals</h3>
            <iframe src="interactive_non_penalty_goals_chart.html" title="Interactive Non-Penalty Goals Chart" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>
            <p>This interactive chart intricately maps out the distribution of non-penalty goals throughout the duration of football matches, 
                offering a granular view of scoring patterns that go beyond mere statistics. By meticulously aggregating shot data and representing it across match minutes, 
                viewers are invited to explore the strategic timings and frequencies of goals. Each bar in the histogram corresponds to a specific minute in the game,
                with its height indicating the number of goals scored during that minute, excluding penalties. 
                The color intensity of each bar represents the average expected goals (xG) value, providing insights into the quality of scoring opportunities. 
                This visualization not only encourages a deeper understanding of game dynamics but also enables an analysis of teams' attacking prowess and resilience under pressure. 
                By interactively selecting ranges within the histogram, users can uncover detailed xG statistics, 
                fostering an appreciation for the nuanced strategies teams employ across different phases of a match. </p>

            <h3>Shot Map</h3>
            <iframe src="interactive_shot_map.html" title="Interactive Shot Map" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>
            <p>This dynamic shot map offers an immersive exploration into the spatial and qualitative aspects of shots taken in football matches, 
                encapsulating the essence of scoring opportunities and defensive challenges. By plotting each shot based on its field location, 
                the visualization reveals patterns of play and strategic approaches to goal-scoring. Colors denote the expected goals (xG) value for each shot,
                transitioning from cooler to warmer hues to illustrate the likelihood of each attempt to find the back of the net. 
                Users can hover over individual shots to reveal detailed information, including the minute and second of the attempt, the player responsible, 
                and the team's name, enriching the narrative of the match with every interaction. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, this shot map serves as a powerful analytical tool,
                enabling fans, analysts, and coaches alike to dissect team formations, pinpoint areas of strength and vulnerability, and strategize with precision.
                It encapsulates the drama and anticipation of every shot, transforming raw data into a vivid storyboard of matchday action. </p>
