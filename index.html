            <h3>Goal Distribution by Match Phase and Team</h3>
            <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v6.min.js"></script>
            <script src='main.js'></script>
            <p>This D3 bubble chart vividly displays the distribution of goals across
                different match phases in the Qatar 2022 World Cup, categorized by continent. Each bubble represents a team, 
                with its size proportional to the number of goals scored during a specific phase of the gameâ€”Early Game, 
                Mid-Game First Half, Mid-Game Second Half, and Late Game. The colors of the bubbles are strategically used 
                to indicate the continent to which each team belongs, enhancing the visual differentiation and making it easy 
                to identify geographical patterns in playing styles or strategies. This visualization not only serves as a 
                tool for exploring how different teams perform throughout various stages of a match but also highlights
                the influence of continental football cultures on team performance. </p>
